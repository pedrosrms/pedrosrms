  Sup, I'm @pedrosrms, and that's my profile. I actually don't send many things to here, but I'm trying to change It. 
  I'm from Brazil, and I'm a dev about 2 years. At the moment I'm studying IT Technician for Internet (yeah, this name is horrible, but It's not my fault) in IFSul.
  I like to program in all languages, obviously I don't program at all, but I like learning.
  If you want to get in touch, send me an email (silvaramospedro135@gmail.com) or send me a direct message on Instagram (@rms_pdr).
  Nice to meet you XD
